# Heap and Dijkstra in MIPS

This project was developed back in **2023** during my college coursework.
It focuses on implementing a **min-heap** data structure and **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** using **MIPS assembly**.

## What it does

* Implements core heap operations (insert, extract-min, heapify).
* Uses the heap as a priority queue for Dijkstra’s algorithm.
* Finds and prints the shortest path from a given source node.

## Tools Used
* MARS MIPS simulator
